# Stage 4 Starter Specification: Live Cm–Alpha Relationship and Trim

Student name: `Chiraphon Su.`

Complete only the boxes marked **STUDENT COMPLETES**. The instructor-provided engineering scope and the implementation contract must not be edited. When the specification is complete and approved, attach this one file to ChatGPT.

## Learning Mode

`concept`

Topic ID: `stability`

## 1. Engineering Question

At the selected angle of attack, is the simplified pitching-moment model trimmed, and does a small angle-of-attack disturbance create a restoring moment tendency?

## 2. Physics Model

Use the linear, quasi-static pitching-moment model:

```text
alpha_rad = alpha_deg * pi / 180
Cm(alpha) = Cm0 + Cm_alpha * alpha_rad
alpha_trim_rad = -Cm0 / Cm_alpha                when Cm_alpha is not zero
delta_alpha_rad = delta_alpha_deg * pi / 180
delta_Cm = Cm_alpha * delta_alpha_rad
```

Where:

- `Cm0` is the pitching-moment coefficient at zero angle of attack;
- `Cm_alpha` is the pitching-moment coefficient slope per radian;
- `alpha` is the selected angle of attack; and
- `delta_alpha` is a small angle-of-attack disturbance about the selected condition.

Use positive pitching moment and positive angle of attack as nose-up. Convert every angle supplied in degrees to radians before applying `Cm_alpha`, because its unit is per radian.

Classify the disturbance by the sign of `delta_alpha_rad * delta_Cm`:

- negative: restoring tendency;
- positive: destabilizing tendency; and
- zero: neutral tendency.

Treat the selected condition as trimmed when `abs(Cm(alpha)) <= 1e-6`. Otherwise it is not trimmed. When `Cm_alpha` is zero, no unique trim angle can be calculated. Report that trim angle as not available rather than dividing by zero.

Required earlier capability:

- ID: `loads.pitch.component-sum`
- Minimum version: `1`
- Purpose here: Stage 4 must remain locked until the earlier longitudinal moment-contribution capability is installed. Do not import or repeat an earlier stage's equations.

The exercise repository already contains the completed Stage 1–3 modules and the installed-but-locked Stage 5–14 modules. Creating Stage 4 must complete that existing dependency chain. Do not create, regenerate, or edit files for any other stage.

Capability provided by this feature:

- ID: `stability.pitch.cm-alpha`
- Version: `1`

## 3. Inputs and Units

Use exactly these canonical aircraft inputs:

| Input | Meaning | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cm0` | zero-angle pitching-moment coefficient | dimensionless |
| `cmAlphaPerRad` | pitching-moment coefficient slope | 1/rad |
| `angleOfAttackDeg` | selected angle of attack | deg |
| `disturbanceAlphaDeg` | small angle-of-attack disturbance | deg |

Do not add a second local copy of these inputs and do not request new aircraft fields.

## 4. Outputs and Units

Display:

- pitching-moment coefficient at the selected angle, `Cm(alpha)`, dimensionless;
- trim angle, in degrees, or a short `not available` result when no unique trim angle exists;
- disturbance moment-coefficient change, `delta_Cm`, dimensionless;
- whether the selected condition is trimmed; and
- restoring, neutral, or destabilizing disturbance tendency.

Also make the calculated values available through the provided `stability.pitch.cm-alpha` capability for later stages.

## 5. Assumptions

- The `Cm`–alpha relationship is linear over the investigated range.
- The model is quasi-static and represents a small disturbance about the selected condition.
- `Cm0` and `Cm_alpha` represent the same aircraft configuration and flight condition.
- The assigned sign convention is positive nose-up pitching moment and positive nose-up angle of attack.

## 6. Validity Limits

- Do not use this linear relationship at stall, at large angle of attack, or where aerodynamic coefficients are strongly nonlinear.
- This model does not calculate a time history, damping, control motion, or handling quality.
- A restoring tendency in this model is not proof of acceptable safety, controllability, or flightworthiness.
- The calculated trim angle is meaningful only when the linear model remains valid at that angle.

## 7. Expected Physical Behavior — STUDENT COMPLETES

Before asking ChatGPT for code, complete each prediction in your own words.

1. If `Cm_alpha < 0` and the angle-of-attack disturbance is positive, `delta_Cm` should be `[COMPLETE]` because `[COMPLETE]`.
2. If `Cm_alpha > 0` and the angle-of-attack disturbance is positive, the response should be `[COMPLETE]` because `[COMPLETE]`.
3. If `Cm_alpha = 0`, changing angle of attack should `[COMPLETE]`.
4. If `Cm0` is fixed and the magnitude of a nonzero `Cm_alpha` increases, the trim angle magnitude should `[COMPLETE]`.
5. Doubling `disturbanceAlphaDeg` while holding `Cm_alpha` fixed should `[COMPLETE]`.

## 8. Reference Calculation — STUDENT COMPLETES

Use the assigned class values or values approved by your instructor. Show the substitution, degree-to-radian conversion, calculation, sign, and units. Do not paste an AI-generated calculation.

```text
Inputs:
Cm0 = [COMPLETE]
Cm_alpha = [COMPLETE] 1/rad
alpha = [COMPLETE] deg
delta_alpha = [COMPLETE] deg

Angle conversion:
alpha_rad = [SHOW WORK]
delta_alpha_rad = [SHOW WORK]

Current pitching-moment coefficient:
Cm(alpha) = [SHOW WORK]

Trim angle:
alpha_trim_rad = [SHOW WORK]
alpha_trim_deg = [SHOW WORK]

Disturbance response:
delta_Cm = [SHOW WORK]

Expected classifications:
selected condition = [trimmed / not trimmed]
disturbance tendency = [restoring / neutral / destabilizing]
```

## 9. Verification Cases — STUDENT COMPLETES

Define all three cases before implementation. Include exact inputs, expected outputs or relationships, units, and a justified numerical tolerance where relevant.

### 9.1 Numerical case

Use your Section 8 reference calculation.

```text
[COMPLETE]
```

### 9.2 Behavioral case

Change one input and state the exact trend or sign that must result.

```text
[COMPLETE]
```

### 9.3 Boundary or sanity case

Use an informative boundary such as zero slope, zero disturbance, or the trim condition. State the exact behavior expected and why division by zero or a false physical claim must not occur.

```text
[COMPLETE]
```

## 10. Feature Requirements

The dashboard must display all outputs in Section 4 and a qualified engineering interpretation based only on this model.

Include one `Cm`–alpha plot:

- x-axis: angle of attack in degrees;
- y-axis: pitching-moment coefficient, dimensionless;
- series: values calculated from the physics function, not typed display values;
- range: -10 deg through +10 deg, including the selected angle of attack; and
- reference line: `Cm = 0`, labeled as the trim line.

Do not add a 3D overlay.

Use an analysis-only Version 4 module. The values and plot update when aircraft inputs change, but this quasi-static model must not claim to predict a time response.

## 11. Files to Create

Create exactly these three new files:

- `src/student/physics/trim-response.js`
- `src/student/features/trim-response.feature.js`
- `tests/student/trim-response.test.js`

Feature ID: `trim-response`

Do not modify any existing file.

## 12. Engineering Decision Enabled — STUDENT COMPLETES

In one or two sentences, state what decision the completed feature will support and what it cannot establish.

```text
[COMPLETE]
```

# Fixed AI Implementation Contract — Do Not Edit

This interaction has two mandatory phases. Do not skip Phase 1 even if the student asks for code immediately.

## Phase 1 — Engineering interpretation and approval

On the first response, do not generate code, pseudocode, file contents, or implementation snippets. Respond only with a complete `## Implementation Interpretation` containing:

1. the exact engineering question;
2. every governing equation with every symbol defined;
3. unit conversions, sign conventions, tolerances, special cases, and classifications;
4. all inputs and units;
5. all outputs and units;
6. expected physical behavior;
7. assumptions and validity limits;
8. the three student-defined verification cases;
9. required and provided capability IDs and versions; and
10. exactly the three paths in Section 11.

End with:

```text
No code has been generated yet.
Reply exactly `APPROVE ENGINEERING INTERPRETATION` to authorize code generation, or describe the engineering correction needed.
```

Use only this completed specification. Do not silently repair, complete, or invent missing engineering information. If a section still contains `[COMPLETE]`, `[SHOW WORK]`, a conflict, or insufficient detail, identify the issue and state that approval cannot proceed.

If the student requests a correction, return a complete revised Implementation Interpretation and request approval again. Do not generate code in the correction response.

## Phase 2 — Code generation after approval

Generate code only after the student replies with the exact phrase `APPROVE ENGINEERING INTERPRETATION` in the same conversation. Approval authorizes implementation of the displayed interpretation only; it is not evidence that the model is correct or valid.

After approval, provide the complete contents of exactly the three new files in Section 11, each in a separately labeled code block. Do not provide patches, partial snippets, extra files, package changes, terminal commands, or edits to existing files.

## Application contract

- The application uses Vite, React, plain JavaScript, and Vitest.
- Put all engineering equations in `src/student/physics/trim-response.js` as exported pure functions.
- The physics file has no React imports, browser dependencies, or mutable shared state.
- Use SI units internally. Convert degree inputs to radians where required and reject obviously invalid numeric inputs.
- Concisely comment input units, output units, sign conventions, and important assumptions.
- Do not add dependencies or modify existing files.
- The application automatically discovers `src/student/features/*.feature.js`.
- The feature file contains no React, JSX, HTML, CSS, class names, inline styles, or imported shared UI components. The application formats structured data automatically.
- Do not request repository files. This specification contains the stable contract needed for this feature.

The shared `aircraft` object contains the four required canonical fields:

```javascript
{
  cm0,
  cmAlphaPerRad,
  angleOfAttackDeg,
  disturbanceAlphaDeg
}
```

## Feature data contract

`src/student/features/trim-response.feature.js` imports functions from its new physics file and exports one `feature` object with this structure:

```javascript
export const feature = {
  contractVersion: 4,
  id: "trim-response",
  title: "Live Cm–alpha relationship and trim",
  description: "One-sentence engineering purpose",
  category: "Stability · Student feature",
  learningMode: "concept",
  topicId: "stability",
  inputKeys: ["cm0", "cmAlphaPerRad", "angleOfAttackDeg", "disturbanceAlphaDeg"],
  requiresCapabilities: [{ id: "loads.pitch.component-sum", version: 1 }],
  providesCapabilities: [{ id: "stability.pitch.cm-alpha", version: 1 }],
  assumptions: ["Concise assumptions from Section 5"],
  validityLimits: ["Concise validity limits from Section 6"],
  simulation: {
    display: "analysis-only",
    durationS: 1,
    initialState: {},
    controls: {},
    disturbance: {}
  },

  analyze(aircraft, capabilityContext) {
    // Confirm the required capability is available, then call imported physics
    // functions. Do not repeat equations or earlier-stage physics here.
    return {
      results: [],
      verificationCases: [],
      decision: {
        question: "The Section 1 engineering question",
        interpretation: "Qualified interpretation based on current results",
        status: "pass"
      },
      plots: [],
      scene: null
    };
  }
};

export const model = {
  kind: "derived",
  evaluate(runtimeContext) {
    // Call the new pure physics functions and return finite calculated values.
    return { values: {} };
  }
};
```

Contract rules:

- `results` contains every output required by Section 4.
- Numeric result values are finite numbers. A result may use short text only for a classification or for the specified unavailable trim angle.
- `unit` is always a string, including `""` for dimensionless values.
- `precision` is a non-negative integer for numeric display.
- Use `emphasis: true` only for the primary result.
- `verificationCases` implements every completed case from Section 9 using the imported physics functions.
- Each `passed` value is a Boolean expression, never hard-coded `true`.
- `decision.status` is `"pass"`, `"caution"`, or `"neutral"` and must not overclaim safety or real-world validation.
- Plot points are calculated with the physics functions. Include `regions: []`; include the required `Cm = 0` line in `referenceLines`.
- `scene` is `null` because Section 10 requests no overlay.
- `model.evaluate(runtimeContext)` returns `{ values }`, does not mutate its context, and does not repeat equations.
- The required Stage 3 capability is read only through `capabilityContext` or `runtimeContext.capabilities`. Do not import an earlier student module.
- Do not invent a time-response model. `analysis-only` still evaluates the capability when inputs change.

## Test contract

- Use Vitest in `tests/student/trim-response.test.js`.
- Import pure functions directly from `../../src/student/physics/trim-response.js`.
- Implement the completed numerical, behavioral, and boundary/sanity cases from Section 9.
- Use justified tolerances for floating-point comparisons.
- Do not test React components or copy equations into the expected-value side of a test when a pre-calculated reference number is available.
- Do not claim that passing tests proves model validity, safety, or real-world validation.

## Required response format

Before approval, return only the engineering interpretation and no code. After approval, briefly state that the approved interpretation is being implemented, then provide the complete contents of the three files in separately labeled code blocks. If missing or conflicting information becomes apparent, stop and return a revised interpretation for approval instead of inventing a model.
